# kml_tools
Tools for providing KML products for EOL catalog maps.  Primarily the aircraft track plot.

acTrack2kml produces the aircraft flight track.
vor_parser subsets the master VOR file for use on a specific project.  The master VOR file is huge and takes minutes to load, so subsutting is required.
